# pygpstruct

This code implements the GPstruct learning algorithm:
- in the chain case, as presented in our [arXiv paper](http://arxiv.org/abs/1307.3846) by S Bratieres, N Quadrianto, Z Ghahramani
- in the grid case, as presented in our [ICML 2014 paper](http://jmlr.org/proceedings/papers/v32/bratieres14.html) by S Bratieres, N Quadrianto, S Nowozin, Z Ghaharamani

An Ipython notebook showing how the source code works can be found [here on nbviewer.ipython.org](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/github/sebastien-bratieres/pygpstruct/blob/master/pygpstruct%20demo.ipynb).

Note that this code is research code: it will evolve and backwards compatibility is not expected.
